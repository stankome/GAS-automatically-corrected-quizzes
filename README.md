Automatically corrected quizzes using Google app script

The quizzes consist of websites developed using Google App Scripts that allows for rendering, automatic correction of the answers, providing grade feedback to the learner, and, in case of approval, generation of an encrypted text string. The encrypted string is unique and thus can be used for verification of quiz approval, granting points and ultimately as a part of course approval.
